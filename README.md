# Captch-up ios
ESGI's IOS course project

### Objective
Creation of an ios app without obligation/restriction

### Application
This ios app contains a game thas uses the Cloud Vision API : the player upload any picture from his gallery and after a call to the Vision API a level is created with the 3 most relevant predictions (score > 80%). Then the player can try to guess them :)</br>
The user is limited up to 5 uploads a day, so to keep the fun going there's an explore page where he can find a level upload by the community.</br>
On the game screen the player can guess the difficulty of the current level by looking at the average number of trials.
</b>Finally, there's a stats page where the user can compare his skills with the community.
